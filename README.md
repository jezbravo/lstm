# Stock predictions with LSTM

## Description

This application exemplifies the implementation of an LSTM network for the prediction of stock values ​​in the market.

### Stack

- Python:
  - Keras
  - Matplotlib
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Scikt Learn
  - Jupiter Notebook

## Setup

First of all you must clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jezbravo/lstm.git
cd lstm
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```python
python.exe -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```python
(venv)pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note the `(venv)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal session operates in a virtual environment set up by "venv".

Once everything is ready:

```python
(venv)python.exe .\app.py
```

## Demo

Both the dataset and the training parameters can be adjusted to improve the performance of the model and obtain better results.
